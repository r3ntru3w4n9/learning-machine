# Getting started into machine learning

We have talked about what machine learning can do in the introduction. However, we've not yet discussed how we are going to do that. In this chapter we are going to briefly talk about the general flow and essential parts of all machine learning problems, you can think this as a formula for problems you solve.

The _Holy Trinity_ of machine learning:

## 1. [Model](./funcs.md)

Every heard of machine learning models? Models _are_ how super smart data scientists call functions. We are humble though.

## 2. [Objective](./obj.md)

How do we determine what is a good function? After all, there are so many ways to determine what is a good function.

## 3. [Optimization](./optim.md)

For a good function to be useful, we have to understand how to get them. Miracles don't happen by themselves.

## [Case Study](./linear-case.md)

Here's an example if you prefer to see an example first. Please remember to come back for formal definitions.
