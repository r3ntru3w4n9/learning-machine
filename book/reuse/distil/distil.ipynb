    "KD refers to the transferring the knowledge of a model into another model. It is mainly used in transferring the knowledge of a big model with billions of parameters into a smaller model that's small enough to deploy on edge devices. The small model is encouraged to perform exactly the same as the bigger model by replicating the bigger model's output, all while being more efficient."

    "\n",
    "We could, of course, train a smaller model from scratch. However, bigger models have tendencies to do a better job in searching a better solution than smaller ones, and trying to replicate bigger models tends to perform better than training a smaller model from scratch, which often stuck in local optimum points."
