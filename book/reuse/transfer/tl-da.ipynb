    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are born and raised in the US, you've not learned a foreign language, and you've never been to another country. Now all of a sudden you are thrown into a small town in Russia, what would you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models feel the same way when you feed them completely different inputs. For example, when a model has only seen MNIST digits, but now you're asking it to classify Full-HD, colorful, picturesque printed numbers taken from a photo, it's no wonder that your model decides not to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those Full-HD numbers are still numbers right? Sure they have something in common with MNIST? Indeed, the same number 1 share some traits and the same number 2 also are roughly similar (just like Russian and English, they are both from humans). But it's still different enough that the machine learning model decides to give up.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL/DA aims to solve that. What TL/DA tries to do, is to make a model work across several similar environments that are different. By applying techniques in TL/DA, a model can perform better in not-so-similar-but-arguably-the-same environments, compared to the the environment where the model is trained."

When reading from medical documents, the mean of the features is $ \\mu' $ and the stddev $ \\sigma' $. A discrepancy-based method basically rescales the features extracted from the feature-extractor $ x' $ to $ \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma'} (x' - \\mu') + \\mu $. And then pass the rescaled features through the classifier."
