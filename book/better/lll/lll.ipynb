    "Humans can learn and memorize things. When we learn about new things, we don't really forget how to do it. A person can probably swim after years of staying out of a swimming pool, or ride a bicycle despite not having ridden on one in decades. However, machine learning models don't seem to be able to do that. When performing updates to a model, the model's ability to perform on the previous tasks are simply destroyed. That's the reason for the existence of LLL, to help machine retain memory over its lifetime."

Using this method, you either hard constrain the maximum distance between the old weight and the new weight, or apply penalties for big distances."

When learning a new task, this approach will try to also re-learn old tasks so the model's ability in performing old tasks don't get affected."

What this method does is that it retains every _updated paths_ that the model has learned. In learning any new task, the knowledge of previous tasks should never be reduced. In mathematical terms, the gradients in learning new tasks and the gradients in learning old tasks should never have a negative dot product."
