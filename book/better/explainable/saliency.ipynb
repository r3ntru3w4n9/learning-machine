    "Saliency maps aims to display _what part of the input is the most important part for a model._ It tries to do so by trying to maximize the input (with respect to an classifier output). For example, we have a picture of a panda, and our model tells us so. To generate a saliency map, we try to maximize the label `panda` by modifying the input. If we In other words, **a saliency map is generated by trying to maximize the chance of the picture being classified.** Most of the time, we use the gradient _ascent_ algorithm to achieve this."
