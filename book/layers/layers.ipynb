    "Layers are basic building blocks of a neural network. You can think of layers as filters. Each layer do something that helps you in your task. It's convenient to think of a big neural network system as many layers working together to achieve a common goal. Don't think too hard. Anything can be a layer. A layer is just a fancy way to refer to a function. It takes in an input and spits out some output. It can be anything, trust me."
