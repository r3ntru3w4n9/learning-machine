    "Initially, we want the LR to be as big as possible (because updates are faster) whenever possible. However, with big LRs, it's difficult to move into a precise location because it only takes big steps. With training progresses, we want to slightly reduce the LR such that we find a more finetuned solution. Some optmizers sort of do this internally (reducing step size by reducing the gradients' scale), but we can always use a learning rate scheduler if we want an explicit LR schedule."
