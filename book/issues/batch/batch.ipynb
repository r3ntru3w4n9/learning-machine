    "\n",
    "Machine learning models are usually trained on batches of data. A batch is simply a number (usually the power of 2), that a model trains itself on in an iteration. For example, batch size 32 means that the model takes in these 32 entries of data, averaging its output, and trains on the 32 labels of the entires."

A smaller variance helps the machine learning model to learn faster, because it's easier to learn from a simpler input than from inputs that can change a lot. For that reason, averages are easier to learn than individuals."
