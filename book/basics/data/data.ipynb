    "Usually when we are asking the machine to learn stuff, the data come in pairs. The input and the output. We call this supervised learning, because it's like telling the machine the right answers directly. There are cases where data are not pairs, we call this unsupervised learning. In the context of unsupervised learning, machines will have to figure out something based on the pattern in the given input. We'll talk about these topics later."
