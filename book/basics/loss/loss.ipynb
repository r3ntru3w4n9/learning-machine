    "Students take exams to evaluate how well they learn in school. Employees are evaluated by companies to see how they perform in their jobs. Thing is, sometimes we just need to know how good a person is in doing a certain task (learning/working). Loss functions are like exams to models. We use loss functions to evaluate models to tell how they perform individually. This is used to rank different models because we care only about the best models. It's a cruel world for models!"
