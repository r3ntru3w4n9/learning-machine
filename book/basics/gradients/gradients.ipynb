    "## Why are gradients useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients are useful because it gives us information about the surface around the parameter. It tells us how we can update the parameters and get a better result.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many optimization methods rely on the existence of gradients. The most prominent one is the one used in deep learning, gradient descent. That's why we need differentiable functions, functions that we can take gradients of, in deep learning in general."

    "## How to determine if a function is differentiable?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many functions in the world. Most of them we don't know the gradients of. In those cases, we simply can't take the gradients of those functions (at least in a computer program). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we can approximate the function well enough with a differentiable function, then we can suddenly take the gradients from the function. For instance, `sin` and `cos` function are approximated using Taylor's expansion series.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are functions that we just don't know how to calculate the gradients for. In the context of deep learning, those functions are just never used. So no worries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is, if a function is differentiable, is composed of differentiable functions, or is approximated by a composed differentiable function, then it's differentiable. Chances are you can use them in deep learning. Other functions, no luck."
