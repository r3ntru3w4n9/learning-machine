    "\n",
    "There are many reason to learn machine. The most obvious reason is that machine learning is quite powerful and useful, and many systems use it ranging from Google's search to snapchat filters. Secondly, it's quite the rage nowadays, so it certainly would help you in landing a prestigious job. Thirdly, in the case where robots take over the world (like Elon Musk feared), having learned machines' ways of dealing things may be your only path to survival! Jokes aside, learning machine does help to calm your nerves since most of the theories on the Internet about robots are just over the top. And learning machine helps preventing you from being tricked by those deceptive information.\n"
