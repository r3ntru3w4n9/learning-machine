    "## When to use GMMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "GMMs are good for creating input. Because it models a distribution by combining several Gaussians, it is capable of generating sample data from that distribution.\n",
    "A GMM is also super useful in that it uses minimal parameters, one average vector $ \\mu $, and one covariance matrix $ \\sigma $ for each Gaussian. And that's it! Usually, it's used when we want a fast way to have a relatively good model."

    "## Why GMMs use Gaussians?\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know gaussians right? The one that looks a bit funny, like a pile of slime. It's also called normal distribution, because of how common it is in modelling the real world. That's the reason for many cases using a few Gaussians in a GMM will produce sufficely good results.\n",
    "Gaussian also has a special property, that it can approximate any distribution given enough Gaussian distributions, which is also the reason it's used in GMM."
