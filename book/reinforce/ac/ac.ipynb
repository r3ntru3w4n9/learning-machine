    "Actor critic sounds cool, but it's nothing special. Remember that policy networks outputs probability? The probability is generated by taking `softmax` (see the previous chapters about softmax), over a vector of scalars, which is usually called **logits**. Here's an interesting fact about logits: because softmax is applied on logits, adding a scalar to all the logits doesn't change the softmax output!"

    "What actor critic does is essentially this, it uses a policy network to generate logits, and uses a value network to generate a scalar. It then subtracts the scalar from the logits, and call the result **advantage**. The scalar acts similarly to the mean of logits, and although it doesn't change the output of the policy model (because the logits are eventually passed into a softmax layer), it helps reduce the variance of the model and makes the model more robust."
