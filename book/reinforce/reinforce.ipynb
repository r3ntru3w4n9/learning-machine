    "## What is RL?\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is a branch of machine learning, focusing on interacting with things. RL was mainly developed by observing animal/human behavior, so it has a lot in common with how humans make decisions. In RL, an **agent** makes an **action** that changes an **environment**, and receives **rewards** in the process. So for example, RL can be used to model how a person, _agent_, decides to have curry for dinner, _action_, which causes some carbon footprint on earth, _environment_, and feels happy about it, _reward_. In other words, RL can be used to model problems that are interactive, about things changing, and how an action will impact future behavior, and making the right decisions. Oh, and eating curry isn't that bad for the planet earth."
