## Why this book?

There are many resources for machine learning on the internet. However, most of them are either

1. Too long. It takes half an hour just to read through.

2. Too math heavy. It takes you forever to understand.

3. Too confusing. The concepts are not strait-forward.

This book aims to solve all of that. It tries to be as concise but easy to grasp as possible.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for learners who want to quickly grasp an idea, without diving deep into a topic (it takes way too long!). The book is a handbook for people who want to preserve their time.

### Disclaimer

This book assumes that you have at least some basic understanding of programming.
