## ü§î Why this book?

There are many resources for machine learning on the internet. However, most of them are either

üòí Too long. It takes half an hour just to read through.

üìê Too math heavy. It takes you forever to understand.

ü§™ Too confusing. The concepts are not straight-forward.

This book aims to solve all of that. It tries to be as concise but easy to grasp as possible.

## üßç Who is this book for?

This book is for learners who want to quickly grasp an idea, without diving deep into a topic (it takes way too long!). The book is a handbook for people who want to preserve their time.

## ‚ùó Disclaimer

This book assumes that you have at least some basic understanding of programming.
