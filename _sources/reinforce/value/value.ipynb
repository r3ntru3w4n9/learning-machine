    "Value function in RL refers to how much reward an agent will get until it arrives at the end state. For example, suppose you get one point each time you celebrate your birthday. And you have a 50 % chance of living to 100 years old, and 50 % of living to 110 years old. Then the value function would be $ 0.5 \\times (100 - x) + 0.5 \\times (110 - x) $, with $ x $ being your current age."

Intuitively, arriving at a state with a higher value means that there would be more rewards in the future, and that's the foundation of RL: _RL aims to maximize the rewards an agent would get, in other words, tries to modify an agent's behavior so that it can be in a state where values are higher._ "
